## 📝 Method overview

![Overview of the AdaptVPR framework](assets/Method.png)
> **Method overview.** AdaptVPR combines scene understanding, generation tailored to each route, selective prompt reflection, and verification of geometric consistency and appearance diversity to improve VPR robustness under changes in weather, illumination, and occlusion.

| Route | Edit | Generator | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global | Weather / illumination / time | [IC-Light](https://github.com/lllyasviel/IC-Light) | 1 attempt; reject on failure |
| Local | Local occlusion | [Qwen-LightX2V](https://github.com/ModelTC/LightX2V) | ≤4 attempts; ≤3 refinements |
| Dual | Global + local changes | [Qwen-LightX2V](https://github.com/ModelTC/LightX2V) | ≤4 attempts; ≤3 refinements |
| Skip | Unsuitable input | None | No generation |

Candidates are accepted only when both $s_{\mathrm{geo}} \ge \tau_{\mathrm{geo}}$ and $s_{\mathrm{div}} \ge \tau_{\mathrm{div}}$.

Scene planning is implemented in `generation/agent.py`, while prompt refinement is handled by `generation/reflection_controller.py`; both are used by the public entry point.

| Threshold | Global | Local | Dual | Dual (rain + vehicle) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $\tau_{\mathrm{geo}}$ | 0.78 | 0.82 | 0.72 | 0.72 |
| $\tau_{\mathrm{div}}$ | 0.15 | 0.09 | 0.20 | 0.12 |

```

## 🛠️ Installation

Python 3.10 or newer is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenshunpeng/AdaptVPR.git
cd AdaptVPR
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp configs/default.env.example .env
```

To run the included HTTP adapters, install their service dependencies separately:

```bash
pip install -r adapters/requirements.txt
```

Install and configure IC-Light, Qwen-LightX2V, VisMatch, and a Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct endpoint separately. Their implementations and weights are not included. Set local paths, endpoints, and credentials in `.env`.

See [Scheduler specification](docs/SCHEDULER.md) for the route-allocation parameters and exact quota rule, [External components](docs/EXTERNAL_COMPONENTS.md) for setup responsibilities, and [API contracts](docs/API_CONTRACTS.md) for the IC-Light and LightX2V interfaces.

## ⚡ Quick Demo

Before running a full generation job, use the ten GSV-Cities paths listed in `tests/demo_10.csv` to quickly check the planning, generation, reflection, and verification pipeline. Source images are not included; run:

Source-to-generated image comparisons for this 10-image Quick Demo set are
available in [`tests/output`](tests/output).

```bash
python tests/run_demo_10.py \
  --gsvcities-root /path/to/Gsvcities \
  --output ./outputs/demo_10
```

This command uses Qwen3-VL-4B planning and enables up to three prompt-reflection attempts by default.
The planner may legitimately choose Skip. By default the demo validates that
all ten sources have completed records and any generated images exist, and
reports generation/Skip counts and observed routes. Add `--strict` to generate
all ten sources through the public released-prompt path: it uses the bundled
official prompts instead of replanning routes, so planner Skip cannot prevent
generation. These prompts cover 2 Global, 4 Local, and 4 Dual tasks. Their dataset
revision and SHA-256 are recorded in `tests/demo_10_prompts.source.json`.
Strict outputs go to `strict_released_reflection_on/` (or `_off/`), independently
of earlier planning runs. `--resume` reuses completed outputs within that run.
Image verification and acceptance thresholds are unchanged: a generated image
can still fail verification and be retained under `rejected/`.

```bash
python tests/run_demo_10.py --gsvcities-root /path/to/Gsvcities \
  --output ./outputs/demo_10 --strict --resume
```
It checks input files, CUDA, dependencies, and service health before planning.
Add `--check-only` to run these checks without loading generation models or starting inference.
Start the generators with `bash scripts/start_generation_services.sh` and wait
for both `/health` endpoints to report ready before running the demo. The startup
script reads `.env` and resolves relative dependency paths against this repository.

## 🚀 Generation

Local and Dual routes use one initial generation and up to three reflection rounds; Global uses one generation.

Accepted final images (`passed=true` and `eligible_for_training=true`) are saved under `<output-root>/<route>/`, while failed candidates are retained for audit under `<output-root>/rejected/<route>/` with a `__rejected.jpg` suffix. Training should use the manifest generated by `scripts/build_manifest.py`, which includes only accepted candidates; generated images are not distributed by this repository.

```bash
# Plan routes and prompts with Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct.
python run.py /path/to/Gsvcities/Images --mode plan --output ./outputs/planner \
  --reflection on --max-reflections 3

# Generate directly from released initial prompts.
python run.py /path/to/AdaptCities/prompts/by_city/Bangkok.jsonl --mode prompt \
  --image-root ./Gsvcities/Images \
  --output ./outputs/prompt \
  --reflection on --max-reflections 3
```

## 📦 Data Availability and License
